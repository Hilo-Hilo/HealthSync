# HealthKit Integration Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation details for integrating HealthKit into the HealthSync application.

## Architecture Decisions

### 1. Singleton Pattern for HealthKitManager
- **Rationale**: HealthKit authorization is app-wide state that should be shared
- **Implementation**: `HealthKitManager.shared`
- **Benefits**: Consistent authorization state, shared HKHealthStore instance

### 2. Async/Await Pattern
- **Rationale**: Modern Swift concurrency for better readability and error handling
- **Implementation**: All HealthKit operations use async/await
- **Benefits**: Avoid callback hell, better error propagation

### 3. Error Handling Strategy
- **Custom Errors**: `HealthKitError` enum for specific error types
- **Error Types**:
  - `notAvailable`: HealthKit not available on device
  - `authorizationFailed`: User denied permission
  - `queryFailed`: Data query failed

## Implementation Details

### Authorization Flow
1. Check if HealthKit is available (`HKHealthStore.isHealthDataAvailable()`)
2. Request authorization for all readable types
3. Store authorization status
4. Handle authorization changes

### Data Type Discovery
- Query all available `HKQuantityTypeIdentifier` cases
- Filter based on authorization status
- Return only accessible types

### Sample Data Queries
- Use `HKSampleQuery` with predicates for date ranges
- Implement proper sorting and limiting
- Handle large datasets efficiently

## Security Considerations
- Minimal data access (only what user selects)
- No data storage on device (process and sync only)
- Proper permission descriptions in Info.plist
- Respect user privacy preferences

## Performance Optimizations
- Lazy loading of data types
- Efficient queries with date ranges
- Background queue processing for heavy operations
- Memory management for large datasets

## Testing Approach
- Mock `HKHealthStore` for unit tests
- Test authorization flows
- Test data queries with mock data
- UI tests for permission dialogs
- Device testing for real HealthKit integration

## Known Limitations
- iOS Simulator has limited HealthKit support
- Some data types not available on all devices
- Background access limitations
- Rate limiting considerations

## Future Enhancements
- Background fetch support
- Data caching strategies
- Incremental sync capabilities
- Enhanced error recovery

## Status: In Progress
