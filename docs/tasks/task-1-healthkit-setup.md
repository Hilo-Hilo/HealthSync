# Task 1: Setup Core Project Structure and HealthKit Integration

## Overview
Initialize the iOS project with SwiftUI, configure HealthKit permissions, and implement the HealthKitManager to access health data types.

## Objectives
- Configure project with HealthKit framework and permissions
- Implement HealthKitManager class with authorization and data fetching
- Set up proper error handling and async/await patterns
- Create unit tests for HealthKit integration

## Implementation Details

### 1. Project Configuration
- **Info.plist Setup**: Add HealthKit usage descriptions
  - `NSHealthShareUsageDescription`: "HealthSync needs access to your health data to sync selected metrics to your chosen destinations."
  - `NSHealthUpdateUsageDescription`: "HealthSync needs to access your health data for syncing purposes."
- **Framework**: Add HealthKit framework to project
- **Deployment Target**: iOS 16+ as specified in PRD

### 2. HealthKitManager Implementation
- **Singleton Pattern**: `HealthKitManager.shared`
- **Authorization**: Request access to all readable HealthKit data types
- **Data Fetching**: Implement methods to fetch available types and sample data
- **Error Handling**: Custom HealthKitError enum for proper error management
- **Async/Await**: Use modern Swift concurrency patterns

### 3. Key Methods to Implement
- `requestAuthorization() async throws -> Bool`
- `fetchAvailableDataTypes() -> [HKQuantityTypeIdentifier]`
- `fetchSamples(for:startDate:endDate:) async throws -> [HKSample]`

## Success Criteria
- ✅ Project configured with HealthKit framework
- ✅ Info.plist contains required HealthKit permissions
- ✅ HealthKitManager implemented with singleton pattern
- ✅ Authorization flow working correctly
- ✅ Can fetch available health data types
- ✅ Can query sample data with proper error handling
- ✅ Unit tests created and passing
- ✅ Documentation updated with implementation details

## Dependencies
- None (foundational task)

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for authorization flow
- Mock HealthStore for testing
- Test data type enumeration
- Test sample query functionality
- UI tests for permission dialogs

## Notes
- HealthKit authorization is one-time per app installation
- Not all data types are available on all devices
- Background permissions may require additional configuration
- Must handle cases where HealthKit is not available (simulator, some devices)

## Status: ✅ Completed
**Started**: 2025-07-05  
**Completed**: 2025-07-05

## Implementation Summary
Successfully implemented the complete HealthKit integration foundation:

### Files Created:
- `HealthSync/Info.plist` - HealthKit permissions and app configuration
- `HealthSync/HealthKitManager.swift` - Core HealthKit integration class
- `HealthSyncTests/HealthKitManagerTests.swift` - Comprehensive unit tests

### Key Features Implemented:
1. **HealthKit Authorization**: Full async/await authorization flow with proper error handling
2. **Data Type Discovery**: Extension to get all available HKQuantityTypeIdentifier cases
3. **Sample Querying**: Generic sample fetching with date range support
4. **Error Management**: Custom HealthKitError enum with descriptive messages
5. **Testing**: Complete test coverage including singleton pattern, authorization, and edge cases

### Technical Notes:
- Supports iOS 16+ as specified in PRD
- Uses modern Swift concurrency patterns (async/await)
- Comprehensive HealthKit data type support (70+ types)
- Proper device capability checking and simulator handling
- Singleton pattern for shared app-wide state
